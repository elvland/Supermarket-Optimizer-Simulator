<h1>Supermarket Simulation Project</h1>
    <p>This Java project simulates a supermarket environment to optimize the number of checkouts for efficient customer service.</p>
    <p>The simulation employs various algorithms and strategies to dynamically adjust the number of open checkouts based on factors such as customer arrival rates, queue lengths, and checkout processing times.</p>
    <p>Through this project, supermarket managers and operators can explore different scenarios and strategies to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.</p>
